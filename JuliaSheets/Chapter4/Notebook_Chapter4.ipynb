    "The probability distribution on measurement outcomes $a$, $b$ given settings $x=0$, $y=0$ - each pillar corresponds to $p(a,b|x,y)$ for $a,b = 00, 01,10,11$. Likewise for the remaining combinations of $x \\in \\{0,1\\}$, $y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ (from left to right). Note, the weighted sum of the probabilities associated with shaded bars give the CHSH winning probability. "
